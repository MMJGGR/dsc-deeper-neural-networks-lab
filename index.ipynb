Detecting Overfitting\n","\n","You'll probably notice that the model did pretty well! It's always recommended to visualize your training and validation metrics against each other after training a model. By plotting them like this, we can easily detect when the model is starting to overfit. We can tell that this is happening by seeing the model's training performance steadily improve long after the validation performance plateaus. We can see that in the plots above as the training loss continues to decrease and the training accuracy continues to increase, and the distance between the two lines gets greater as the epochs gets higher. \n","\n","## Iterating on the Model\n","\n","By adding another hidden layer, we can a given the model the ability to capture more high-level abstraction in the data. However, increasing the depth of the model also increases the amount of data the model needs to converge to answer, because with a more complex model comes the \"Curse of Dimensionality\", thanks to all the extra trainable parameters that come from adding more size to our network. \n","\n","If there is complexity in the data that our smaller model was not big enough to catch, then a larger model may improve performance. However, if our dataset isn't big enough for the new, larger model, then we may see performance decrease as then model \"thrashes\" about a bit, failing to converge. Let's try and see what happens. \n","\n","In the cell below, recreate the model that you created above, with one exception. In the model below, add a second `Dense` layer with `'tanh'` activation function and 5 neurons after the first. The network's output layer should still be a `Dense` layer with a single neuron and a `'sigmoid'` activation function, since this is still a binary classification task. \n","\n","Create, compile, and fit the model in the cells below, and then visualize the results to compare the history.

We can tell because of the greater variance in the movement of the `val_loss` and `val_acc` lines.
